Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Divide and conquer is an algorithm paradigm where a problem breaks into two or more smaller sub-problems or related type until every sub-problem is pretty good enough to solve. After solving each sub-problem, all the solutions to the sub-problems are combined to give a solution to the original problem.
